# MP Suite

#### Collection of code and settings to optimize AutoCAD for your workflow

## Purpose

As a paid CAD Technician and programming enthusiast, I saw my co-workers being slave to the AutoCAD application.
The application was not setup to meet their workflows.  This project will focus on changable settings and scripts
to control the AutoCAD application.
